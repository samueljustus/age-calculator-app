### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

  ## My process
  i started off with writting the html and css then i added javascript.i wrote a function to calculate the age of the user
  then i added media queriies to make it responsve

   ### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- javascrpt
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
working with dates can be so tricky so i learned how to work with dates and how to validate the dates based on the input of the user 
and then i learnt how to calculate the ages of the user.

### Continued development
i'm not fully comfortable with working with dates so i'll continue to improve on that aspect as i learn more. and then i'll pick up
a date library called dayjs.
